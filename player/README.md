## Player
The player module will have the data structure that the server program will use to store and access information about a player.

The main data structure in the player module will be the player_t struct. This structure will contain either pointers to the stored values or if they are integers, the value of the integer. 

## Usage

* To build `player`, run `make`.
* To clean `player`, run `make clean`.

## Assumptions & Comments 
There are no extra assumptions besides those laid out in the specs. See the specs for all details.
