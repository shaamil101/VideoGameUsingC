## Compilation instructions
Clean the directory with `make clean` and compile the maps.a archive file and the mapstest file with `make all`.

## Implementation notes
We follow our implementation spec closely while writing the maps module, please refer to that as it is outlined in the main directory.
There are no known deviations from spec.

## Maps test
Run the maps test with `./mapstest` and see that we can load a file and print it out. You can see visibility working in integration with the server.
